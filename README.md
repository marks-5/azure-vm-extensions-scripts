# azure-vm-extensions-scripts

## Description:

This repository is using for Azure VM Extension and Custom Script Extension.
These extentions download and execute scripts on Azure virtual machines.
Scripts can be downloaded from Azure storage or other accessible internet location, or provided to the extension run time.

## Justification to be a public
Unfortunately there is no auth settings in Extentions to setup it for authentication in GitHub.
In the future it can be moved somewhere to Azure storage.
